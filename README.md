# The_Water_Jugs_Puzzle

Given two jugs, one of which can accommodate a litres of water and the other b litres of
water, determine the number of steps required to obtain exactly c litres of water in one of
the vessels.

At the beginning both vessels are empty. The following operations are counted as 'steps':
● emptying a vessel,
● filling a vessel,
● pouring water from one jug to the other, without spilling, until one of the jugs is either full or empty.

Input
Three positive integers a, b, c, not larger than 40000 separated by spaces.

Output
The steps that are required to obtain c litres in the following format, or -1 if this is
impossible.

Example 1:
Input: 3 5 4
Output: (0, 0) > (3, 0) > (0, 3) > (3, 3) > (1, 5) > (1, 0) > (0, 1) > (3, 1) > (0, 4)
